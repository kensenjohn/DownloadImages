Date: Mar 30, 2011

This application is used to download images from website.
The "props" folder contains "spiderpic.properties" where we can set the url from which to download the pictures.

download_location=/home/kensen/Downloads/images
site_name=http://www.iiiii.com/random.php
download_algo=jjjjjj  #this specifies the different algorithms to use to download pics.

The application executes the URL. It will parse the html that is returned.
It will identify the path of the image and then download the image.

To prevent any kind of Denial of Service, the code will hit the website once in 3 seconds.

DownloadThread.java holds the code/logic to download images.
